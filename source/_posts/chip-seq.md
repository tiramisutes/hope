##简介(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)
ChIP-sequencing, also known as ChIP-seq, is a method used to analyze protein interactions with DNA. ChIP-seq combines chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massively parallel DNA sequencing to identify the binding sites of DNA-associated proteins. It can be used to map global binding sites precisely for any protein of interest. Previously, ChIP-on-chip was the most common technique utilized to study these protein–DNA relations.
ChIP-seq is used primarily to determine how transcription factors and other chromatin-associated proteins influence phenotype-affecting mechanisms. Determining how proteins interact with DNA to regulate gene expression is essential for fully understanding many biological processes and disease states.

###ChIP
The ChIP process enriches specific crosslinked DNA-protein complexes  using an <a href="/wiki/Antibody" title="Antibody">antibody</a> against the protein of interest. For a good description of the ChIP wet lab protocol see <a href="/wiki/ChIP-on-chip" title="ChIP-on-chip">ChIP-on-chip</a>. <a href="/wiki/Oligonucleotide" title="Oligonucleotide">Oligonucleotide</a> adaptors are then added to the small stretches of DNA that were bound to the protein of interest to enable massively parallel sequencing.
###Sequencing
After size selection, all the resulting ChIP-DNA fragments are sequenced simultaneously using a genome sequencer. A single sequencing run can scan for genome-wide associations with high resolution, as opposed to large sets of tilingarrays required for lower resolution ChIP-chip.
##中文解释

ChIP 测序的基本原分为 ChIP 和测序两个步骤。ChIP 是英文 Chromatin immunoprecipitation 的缩写，即染色质免疫沉淀，其步骤包括：细胞内蛋白质和 DNA 的交联、DNA 分子分离及片段化、免疫沉淀和解除交联。测序就是对解除交联后的 DNA 片段进行测序，制备文库时也包括连接测序接头和片段筛选等步骤。由于免疫沉淀的 DNA 片段在蛋白质结合区域周围富集，因此识别蛋白质结合区域转化为检测测序标签富集的区域。在信息处理中，这是一个信号检测的问题。在转录因子 ChIP 测序数据分析中，由于测序标签还会在转录因子结合位点周围形成分布，通过对分布的统计建模分析，可从数据中精确定位结合位点。 
##Computational analysis
The read count data generated by ChIP-seq is massive. It motivates the development of computational analysis methods. To predict DNA-binding sites from ChIP-seq read count data, <a href="/wiki/Peak_calling" title="Peak calling">peak calling</a> methods have been developed. The most popular method is MACS which empirically models the shift size of ChIP-Seq tags, and uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup>
<p>Another relevant computational problem is Differential peak calling, which identifies significant differences in two ChIP-seq signals from distinct biological conditions. Differential peak callers segment two ChIP-seq signals and identify differential peaks using <a href="/wiki/Hidden_Markov_Model" title="Hidden Markov Model" class="mw-redirect">Hidden Markov Models</a>. Examples for two-stage differential peak callers are ChIPDiff<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> and ODIN.
