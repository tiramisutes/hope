##Isoforms
###Definition(s)
Different forms of a protein that may be produced from different genes, or from the same gene by alternative splicing.

The protein products of different versions of messenger RNA created from the
same gene by employing different promoters, which causes transcription to
skip certain exons. Since the promoters are tissue-specific, different tissues
express different protein products of the same gene.

##Gene
###Definition(s)
The functional and physical unit of heredity passed from parent to offspring. Genes are pieces of DNA, and most genes contain the information for making a specific protein.

The basic unit of heredity, consisting of a segment of DNA arranged in a linear
manner along a chromosome, which codes for a specific protein or segment
of protein leading to a particular characteristic or function.

The gene is the basic physical unit of inheritance. Genes are passed from parents to offspring and contain the information needed to specify traits. Genes are arranged, one after another, on structures called chromosomes. A chromosome contains a single, long DNA molecule, only a portion of which corresponds to a single gene. Humans have approximately 23,000 genes arranged on their chromosomes.

The fundamental physical and functional unit of heredity. A gene is an ordered sequence of nucleotides located in a particular position on a particular chromosome that encodes a specific functional product (i.e., a protein or RNA molecule).
