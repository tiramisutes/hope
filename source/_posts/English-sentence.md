<li>It is time to 'upgrade' cancer epigenetics research and put together an ambitious plan to tackle the many unanswered questions in this field using epigenomics approaches.</li>
<li>Histones are no longer considered to be simple 'DNA-packaging' proteins; they are recognized as being dynamic regulators of gene activity that undergo manypost-translational chemical modifications, including acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitylation and sumoylation.</li>
<li>In addition to their influence on gene expression, emerging evidence indicates that specific histone modifications interface with other nuclear processes.</li>
<li>Histone modifications, together with DNA methylation, also have a vital role in organizing nuclear architecture,which, in turn, is involved in regulating transcription and other nuclear processes.</li>
<li>However, what distinguishes metabolomics from clinical chemistry is the fact that in metabolomics one is not attempting to characterize a few compounds at a time, but literally dozens or even hundreds of compounds at a time.</li>
<li>Blood is a special biofluid, as it potentially reflects all processes going on in all organs. This can be both a blessing and a curse, as metabolite perturbations in the blood, while easily detectable, cannot be easily traced to a specific organ or a specific cause.</li>
<li>On a cellular level, organisms face two main challenges: to maintain genome integrity in the face of mutagens and mobile genetic elements, and to express a specific repertoire of genes at the proper level and with the appropriate timing.</li>
<li>In sharp contrast to the low within-species genetic variation, differences between species-specific haplotypes were high.</li>
